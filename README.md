# SoccerTrainer
This is a simple web application that generates a random number and a random color every 5 seconds (or a user-defined interval) within a given range of numbers and displays it on the page. The user can set the range of numbers and the interval between updates using two sliders.

## Getting Started
To use this application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see the application interface with the output area, countdown area, and two sliders.

## Usage
Changing the Interval
To change the interval between updates, use the interval slider located at the top of the page. Move the slider left or right to decrease or increase the interval, respectively. The current interval value will be displayed next to the slider.

## Changing the Number Range
To change the range of numbers that can be generated, use the number range slider located below the interval slider. Move the slider left or right to decrease or increase the maximum number, respectively. The minimum number is always 1, so the range will be displayed as 1 to the maximum number selected. The current range will be displayed next to the slider.

## Displaying Random Numbers and Colors
The application will display a random number and color every 5 seconds (or the user-defined interval) within the selected range. The number will be displayed in the output area, and the countdown area will show the time remaining until the next update.

## Built With
This application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses the setInterval() and clearInterval() functions to handle the countdown and update intervals.

## Acknowledgments
This application was inspired by various JavaScript tutorials and exercises online.
